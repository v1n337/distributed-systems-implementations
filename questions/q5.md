# NFS caching mechanism can lead to some user-observable inconsistency. Can you describe an example where a user sees the system do something that is odd or undesirable?

A user-observable inconsistency might occur in a scenario involving multiple clients writing to a single centralized NFS.

Due to NFS caching on both the client and the server side, the write operations performed by one client might not be instantaneously visible on other clientsâ€™ caches. This will lead to an obvious inconsistency between the actual data on the server and what is present on the caches of the other client, unless the cache is invalidated and fetched once again from the server.
