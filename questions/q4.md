##Pick one figure from the comparison paper that you think is most interesting. Describe what you think is most interesting about it, in a sentence or three.

I found Figure 3, labelled 'Tuning Knot â€“ blocking sendfile' to be the most interesting.

My intuition before reading the paper was that non-blocking system calls would always have better performance benchmarks as compared to the blocking call counterparts. 
However, this is not the case for the Knot, for which the architecture is based on 'single thread per connection'. 
The bandwidth for the blocking implementation exceeds that of the non-blocking implementation of sendfile, as shown in correlation with Figure 2.

I suppose the reason for this could be the existence of queued operations, as would be in a non-blocking sendfile call, in which a single file might require the invocation of the sendfile method several times. 
In the blocking implementation of the call, however, an entire file can be written using a single invocation of the call.
