# Hardware

## Motivation for Data-Centers
* Economy of scale
* Considerations
    * High performance (requests per sec)
    * Inexpensive (requests per $)
    * Power-efficiency (requests per watt) 


## Computation
* SMP = Shared Multi-processor
    * HPC
    * Expensive
* Commodity hardware
    * Inexpensive
    * Lower cost
* Wimpy nodes
    * Speedup limit is determined by Amdahl's law. 1 / (1 - p) where p represents the fraction of parallelized code.
    * Network cost
    * Low utilization

## Storage
* NAS - Network Attached Storage
    * Easy deployment
    * Easier maintenance
    * Low write overhead
* Distributed Systems - GFS
    * Cost effective
    * High availability - not dependent on a single appliance
    * Higher perfomance - many networks
    * Higher network overhead

### Fault tolerance - Replication / Erasure coding

## Switches
* Hierarchy used for fault tolerance

## Paradigm Shifts
* Large Memory
* Flash, Kinetic Disks, Shingled Disks
* Software-defined networking

# Software
* Online - queries, high availability
* Offline - batch processing, compute + I/O intensive

## Metrics for availability
* Uptime (percent of time where service is available)
* Yield (percent of requests served)
* Harvest (percent of data available)
* DQ principle : Data per query * QPS = constant
