# RPC

## Modes of Communication
* Raw message passing: Low level, and not easy to use
    * TCP/IP: reliable stream
    * UDP: unreliable, connectionless, packet oriented
* Distributed shared memory - remote access done if copy isn't present locally. Application is agnostic of the network components
    Higher overhead, and failure handling is difficult
* File system - Low level + slow
* RPC - middle ground: Easy to program,  and doesn't require sharing of the complete address space

For the RPC architecture, refer to the paper

## Working of RPC

## Problems
* Pointers to local address space, and invocation on a remote node
* Pointers can be used as input/output
* Complex pointer structures

## Binding to remote servers
* System described in te paper uses Grapevine(reliable & replicated)
* Client gets the address from Grapevine, then uses the address and function id to invoke the procedure
* Server returns Table index and function ID to the client
* Client tries to invoke the function using table index, fun ID, call ID and args

## RPC-Runtime
* Why not TCP? High overhead in terms of latency and server state(having to keep several open TCP connections)
* Why not UDP? Unreliable, doesn't wait for acknowledgements of packet reception
* Call ID used to enforce 'precisely once' semantics of procedure execution.
* Probes the server periodically to ensure that the server is still up

## Sending large packets
* Ordered segments of request packets sent sequentially
* Slow and inefficient, but easy to implement
