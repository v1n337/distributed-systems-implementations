## Motivation for distributed systems
Performance, scalability, availability

## Requirements for distributed systems

### Communications
The distributed systems talking to each other

### Fault tolerance
Continue running at a lower level of performance or availability

Considerations:
* Where to fix the problem?
    * End-to-end .. like ACK
* What state to recover to?
    * Depends on the application. Might even choose to not recover to any former state.
* When to recover?
    * Eager, lazy or when needed

### Concurrency/Consistency
* Goals is to leverage the concurrecy to use faster systems
* Challenge is maintaining correctness on multiple copies of the data
