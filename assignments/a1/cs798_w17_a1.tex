\part{Raw Communication}

\section{TCP - Sending 1 byte and receiving an ack}
\begin{itemize}
	\item For the local system, the round trip time is 52 microseconds
	\item For remote systems, the round trip time is 688 microseconds
\end{itemize}

\section{TCP - Sending large amounts of data}
\begin{itemize}
	\item For the local system, the throughput is 126 MBps
	\item For remote systems, the throughput is 1.36 MBps
\end{itemize}


\section{TCP - Overhead of connection establishment}
1000 bytes transferred
\begin{itemize}
	\item For a single byte transfer per connection, the latency is 736052 microseconds.
	\item For batched byte transfter (10 per batch), the latency is 109027 microseconds.
\end{itemize}

The overhead per extra connection attempt is 670 microseconds.

\section{UDP - Packet Loss} \label{udp_packet_loss}
\begin{itemize}
	\item For the local system, raw UDP starts dropping packets at 6723152 bytes
	\item For remote systems, raw UDP starts dropping packets at 32474296 bytes
\end{itemize}

\part{Reliable UDP}

\section{Throughput of reliable UDP implementation}
For 5GB of data on the same machine:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If sending in 50kb chunks, the throughput is 1843 MBps
	\item If sending in 5kb chunks, the throughput is 296 MBps.
\end{itemize}

For 5GB of data on the different machines:

\section{Bandwidth optimization}
From the above experiment, the bandwidth can be optimized by making the packet size for each transfer as close to the threshold identified in Q\ref{udp_packet_loss}.

\part{Google RPC}

\section{Latency of request/response}
Using 100 bytes as the transfer payload over 100 RPC calls, the average request/response time was 256 microseconds.

\section{Round trip time improvement}
The first round-trip is approximately 4-5 times higher than the overall average, for 100 RPC calls.

\section{Overhead compared to barebones UDP}


\section{Throughput between 2 machines}
