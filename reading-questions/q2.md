### Detail a scenario under which 2PC blocks? Present a timeline of events and explain why the protocol can not make progress?

A scenario where 2PC blocks is described below, as a timeline of events:
* Co-ordinator sends a PREPARE message to all cohorts
* All of the cohorts respond with a COMMIT-VOTE
* In the meantime, the co-ordinator encounters a hardware failure and goes down before issuing a COMMIT message to the cohort
* Now that the co-ordinator in inaccessible and the fact that 2PC is a blocking protocol, the cohorts might never receive a final outcome for this transaction.
* Until the co-ordinator comes back online and sends an outcome, this transaction will remain unresolved.
* The protocol can't make progress because it is relying on the coordinator to determine the final outcome of the transaction, based on the responses of the other participants in the distributed commit.
